# Challenges

* [diagonal_differences.py](https://github.com/Danielo814/HackerRank/blob/master/diagonal_differences.py)

    Takes a square matrix and calculates the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
    For example, the square matrix  is shown below
    ```python
    arr = [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [9, 8, 9]
    [
     ```
    The left-to-right diagonal = **1 + 5 + 9 = 15**. The right to left diagonal = **3 + 5 + 9 = 17**. Their absolute difference is 2.


* [plusMinus.py](https://github.com/Danielo814/HackerRank/blob/master/plusMinus.py)

  Takes an array of integers and calculates the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Prints the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.
  For example, given the array **arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]**  there are **5**  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios would be **2/5 = 0.400000**, **2/5 = 0.400000**  and **1/5 = 0.200000**


* [staircase.py](https://github.com/Danielo814/HackerRank/blob/master/staircase.py)

  Takes a number and makes a staircase using **'#'** symbol with base and height both equal to **n**. Example output with **n = 5**:

  * [mini_max_sum.py](https://github.com/Danielo814/HackerRank/blob/master/mini_max_sum.py)

    Takes five positive integers, finds the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
