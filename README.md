* [diagonal_differences.py](https://github.com/Danielo814/HackerRank/blob/master/diagonal_differences.py)

    Takes a square matrix and calculates the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
    For example, the square matrix  is shown below
    `1 2 3

     4 5 6

     9 8 9`
    The left-to-right diagonal = **1 + 5 + 9 = 15**. The right to left diagonal = **3 + 5 + 9 = 17**. Their absolute difference is 2.
